2 --> Given a positive integer N, MoEngage wants you to determine if it is possible  to rearrange             
                the digits of N (in decimal representation) and obtain a multiple of 5.
                For example, when N=108, we can rearrange its digits to construct 180=36⋅5 which is a multiple of 5

3 --> Remove duplicate elements from sorted Array
                N = 5
        Array = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
        Output: 2

4 -->shortest gcd in a limt
        3 , 10
        output- 3,6
