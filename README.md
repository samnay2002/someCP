2 --> Given a positive integer N, MoEngage wants you to determine if it is possible  to rearrange             
                the digits of N (in decimal representation) and obtain a multiple of 5.
                For example, when N=108, we can rearrange its digits to construct 180=36â‹…5 which is a multiple of 5
